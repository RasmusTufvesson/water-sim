# Water sim
Just a little simulation that i made because i can.

It works by creating a grid of cells that count how many water particles are in them. This is then used by each water particle to try and get to a cell with a lower density.

You can also create circles of different sizes that are basically just particles with a size. They are a bit janky and water can get stuck inside them because particls just check adjacent cells.
